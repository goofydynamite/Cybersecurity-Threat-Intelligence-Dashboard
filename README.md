Developed a dynamic, real-time dashboard prototype to simulate the detection of cybersecurity threats, 
designed to empower Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts.
 Engineered a front-end using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to visualize a simulated data 
stream from Kafka, mimicking a production environment where data is warehoused in Snowflake.
 The platform's core logic simulates an unsupervised AI model (Isolation Forest) by generating and 
flagging events with high anomaly scores in real-time, distinguishing malicious activity from normal 
network traffic.
Created interactive data visualizations with ApexCharts, similar to Tableau, to display key metrics, 
including anomaly trends, login failures by geo-location, and network traffic by protocol.
